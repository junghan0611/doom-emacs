# Introduction

Source contend and generated static content for the Practicalli Doom Emacs book.

The Practicalli Doom Emacs provides practical guides to software development tasks, using predominantly the Clojure and ClojureScript languages.  Most of the editing techniques and tools are applicable to any editing tasks.

Doom Emacs is an open source project to provide configuration to add 150+ packages to Emacs, without having to writing a lot of common configuration code.
