# Why Doom Emacs

Practicalli is evaluating Doom Emacs after many years of using Spacemacs (which is still the main Emacs configuration used)

Potential reasons to use Doom as an alternative

- package mangager pins specific versions of packages
- more comprehensive support for Clojure LSP UI elements compared to Spacemacs (docs, etc7)
- Vim-style editing even more prevelent in Doom (as it doesnt have some of the features of Spacemacs), so may help with adoption of Neovim & Conjure
 

## Migrating from Spacemacs

The two challenging areas are percieved to be 

1.  key bindings (mnemonic and consistent key bindings used in Spacemacs are not consistent in Doom)
2.  Features available (modules in Doom) - Doom is advertised as quite minimal


## Irelevant aspects

- Startup speed - a few seconds to start up Emacs is perfectly fine for the Practicalli workflow, where Emacs typically stays running for weeks or months
-
